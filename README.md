# 42-ft_select
The goal of this project is to create a terminal UI using the termcaps library.
The program takes in a list of arguments (as command line arguments), then displays them,
allowing the user to cycle through and select whatever he/she chooses. The selected arguments are
then displayed back on the command line.
